"""
The classes in this module are mixins that are used to build tasklets with DTS
capabilities. Mixins are similar to base classes in a multiple inheritance
design. The main difference is that they are not intended to be classes in
their own right, but represent optional functionality that can be used to
compose a particular type of tasklet.
