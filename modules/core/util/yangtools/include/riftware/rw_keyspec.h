/*
   ATTN: leftover notes from design. Delete me or implement:


   ATTN: If we can keep namespace numbering relative, then is it possible
   to apply simple offsets in app-specific schemas?
    - probably not: it would be hard to keep namespaces relative in a
      global sense?  Probably not if that global numbering includes all
      known namespaces, even unrelated ones.
    - However, is it possible to keep namespaces relative in a relative
      sense.  How would such a relative namespace counting strategy work?
       - For any given, schema-rooted, augmented node:
          - Sort the list of modules traversed in getting to the node, and
          module of the node's type.
    - Data structures:
        struct rw_ns_version_t {
          bool is_local; # 1 bit
          rw_ns_id_t ns;
          rw_ns_rev_t rev; # given that revs only occur on whole days, not many bits are needed (certainly 25 or less)
        }
        rw_ns_id_t ns_system_map[local_ns] => local_ns
        rw_ns_id_t ns_local_map{sys_ns} => system_ns
        generated_ns_state_struct {
          const rw_ns_id_t local_ns_map;
          atomic rw_ns_id_t system_ns_map;
        }


   In any given schema, there are a limited, enumerable, number of uses of
   any source grouping, possibly changing with yang file version.  All
   such uses can be uniquely identified with the following tuple:
     <Schema-uses-statement-index, Schema-namespace-index, Schema-date>
       - Ultimate-uses-statement-index: This is an orginal numbering of
         the outer-most enclosing uses statement, as determined by a
         compiled yangpbc schema of a collection of yang modules, where
         index 1 is defined as the un-augmented un-refined definition, and
         all augmented and/or refined instances have their own index
         values.  Code that uses the grouping  ATTN

   What happens when someone violates the restrictions and delete/adds
   keys, or illegally reorganizes the yang structure?
    - need to be able to remap from one module into another?
    - need to be able to translate fields from one type to another?


   Additions to a schema due to revisions are more-or-less equivalent to
   augments.  But deletions and attribute changes are not - they can have
   serious consequences.  Therefore, the yangpbc compiler needs to compare
   differences between schemas and react accordingly.  With annotations,
   it may be possible to define translations.

   Without annotations, the best thing we can do is require that the
   previous version be avilable for inspection, so that yangpbc can detect
   the changes and blow up?  What about detecting changes against all
   revisions?

   Can each new revision obtain a unique starting tag number?
   Programmatically, or by annotation?


   App understanding rooted keyspec
   App understanding relative keyspec
   App registering for rooted keyspec
   App registering for relative keyspec

   When app's registration is relative to a grouping, DTS needs to convert
   from rooted path to grouping path, and vice-versa, at member API
   boundary
    - in theory, a complete, rooted, keyspec can be walked, relatively
      efficiently, by generated code, into something the app can
      understand.  The app can get the fully rooted path, or the
      grouping-relative path, at its option.



   ATTN: Augments could be added into protoc-c structs with minimal extra
   syntax at point of use, if the augment struct's fields are included
   inline in the parent struct, including base pointer, after all normal
   fields.

     struct base {
       PBCMD* base_pbcmd;
       type_t base_field_1;
       type_t base_field_2;
       # more base fields

       # now revision rev_2... #
       bool has_rev_2;
       PBCMD* rev_2_pbcmd;
       type_t rev_2_field_1;
       # ...more rev_2 fields

       #  now augment aug_a... #
       bool has_aug_a;
       PBCMD* aug_a_pbcmd;
       aug_ns_t* aug_a_ns_data; # not intended to be used by app code
       type_t aug_a_field_1;
       # ... more aug_a fields

       #  now augment aug_b... #
       #
          ATTN: Ideally, the has_augment_b is really spread across the
          various augment fields...  The app doesn't want to care about
          augment_b; it just wants to care about the fields.  However, it
          would "just work" is the augment's has is simply always true.
       #
       bool has_aug_b;
       PBCMD* aug_b_bpbcmd;
       aug_ns_t* aug_b_ns_data; # not intended to be used by app code
       type_t aug_b_bfield_1;
       # ... more aug_b fields
     };


   ATTN: If I'm an app coded in terms of a grouping, and some module in my
   schema modifies that grouping, can I get notificatins in terms of the
   modification?  The app will have two mutually-distinct struct
   definitions; the registration must occur with the context of the
   desired structure format.  That registration can occur for the
   augmented case only with a rooted registration, or enclosing
   grouping-uses registration.


   yang char mappings:
    -[_-.]    => _dashX
    -X        => _dash_X
    .X        => _dot_X
    _[^1ydu]  => _1_X
    _d        => _1_X
    __X  => __2_X
    ___X => __3_X
    ...


   ATTN: Another possible way to uniquely identify all fields in a message
   is to assign each field a module-unique tag number, that it always
   uses.  Perhaps assigned by a total file ordering of all identifiers.
    - global by file
    - global by level
    - globally numbered by complex object, then offset by field
       - each augment, container, list, grouping, choice, rpc-io, and
         notification, gets its own complex-object number, and each field
         within the complex object is offset form the object.
       - By default, segregate the space into categories, so that fewer
         renumberings are required.


   2^29 tags:
    - 256M reserved for future use
    - reserve the first M for ns (and protobuf reserved)
    - reserve the second M for extensions
    - reserve 4M for escapes
    - leaves 250 M for splitting the ranges
       - 64 depth, at 2 M ids per depth, in encounter order
         (this schema would break if a revision pushes levels, but doesn't
         actually change the XML mapping
       - 100 container/list depth, at 1 M ids per depth, in encounter order
         (this schema would break if a revision pushes levels, but doesn't
         actually change the XML mapping
