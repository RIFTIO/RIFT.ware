    description
      "Initial implementation of RW.Zookeeper.
       The yang definition captures the configuration 
       information for zookeeper. An example configutaion is
       shown below:
                tickTime=2000
                dataDir=/var/zookeeper
                clientPort=2181
                initLimit=5
                syncLimit=2
                server.1=zoo1:2888:3888
                server.2=zoo2:2888:3888
                server.3=zoo3:2888:3888

       If you want to test multiple servers on a single machine, 
       specify the servername as localhost with unique 
       quorum & leader election ports 
       (i.e. 2888:3888, 2889:3889, 2890:3890 in the example above) 
       for each server.X in that server's config file. 
       Of course separate dataDirs and distinct clientPorts 
       are also necessary (in the above replicated example, 
       running on a single localhost, 
       you would still have three config files).";
