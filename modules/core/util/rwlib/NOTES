MISC TODO
---------
o SKLIST work:
   - cleanup rift_sklist memory alloc/free
   - Do skiplists require support for: VX_SKLIST_TAIL() and VX_SKLIST_PREV() ???
   - Possible performance optimization:
     NOTE the type rift_sklist_element_t contains an element "node" of type rift_sklist_node_t
     When the hight of the node is only 1, it would be possible to embed the node into the node
     pointer itself.  This would be tricky, but would def improve performance.
     A simpler/less-ugly solution would be to embed an instance of rift_sklist_node_t with height 1 into
     type rift_sklist_element_t.  The downside of this approach is extra memory consumption.

o User-defined pseudo-modules w/interfaces APIs
  that can be installed/defined by the application itself
  with a common interface api that does the right thing...
