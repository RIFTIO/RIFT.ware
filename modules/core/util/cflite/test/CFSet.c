/************************************
 Collection callbacks

 A collection has a set of callbacks (function pointers)
  that will be called, at appropriate times, to manage
  certain aspects of the items (objects) in your collection.

 This allows you customize a set, or any other kind of
  collection, to use your particular kind of data.
  The rest of the collection library then does all of
  the work of storing, sorting, searching, and deleting items
  from the collection.

 If what you're putting into the collection are standard
  Core Foundation "objects" (CFString, CFNumber, and so on),
  then you don't have to write callbacks. That work has
  already been done for you. Simply pass the
  CFSetRetainCallBack constant and your set is ready to use.

 The favorites set is a colletion of simple C string pointers.
 These functions create a set that can store, find, and compare
 C string pointers.

  //  the caller expects.

  //  C strings are equal or not.

  //  the so-called hash code of the item. A hash code is an integer
  //  number that makes comparing and searching for items much faster.
  // The number returned can be anything, but it must follow this rule:
  //  - Two items that are equal MUST return the same hash code
  //
  // The set is most efficient when any two items that are not equal
  //  return different numbers for their hash code. Since this is
  //  impossible (there are many more possible strings than possible
  //  hash code numbers), the idea is to create a hash code function
  //  that makes it unlikely that two different strings would return
  //  the same number. The more unlikely, the better the hash code,
  //  function, and the more efficient the set.

    //     type conversion, the << operator would happily shift
    //     the bits of the char right into outerspace, since
    //     a char can only hold 8 bits. By converting it first,
    //     the bits of the char now occupy the lower bits of
    //     a much larger integer, and have someplace to go
