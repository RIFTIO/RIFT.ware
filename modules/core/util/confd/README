In order to build this product from opensource, it is necessary to copy in
confd packages from Cisco first:

If you do NOT have access to the licensed package confd-6.0.linux.x86_64.zip
from Cisco:

  Download confd-basic-6.0.linux.x86_64.zip from Cisco DevNet Downloads
  at https://developer.cisco.com/site/confD/downloads/ and extract the file to
  a location on your system.

  The zip archive contains several files, but you need only the following two:
  - confd-basic-6.0.linux.x86_64.installer.bin
  - confd-basic-6.0.libconfd.tar.gz

  Move or copy the extracted confd files to this directory on the VM.  Note
  that there are empty placeholder files already in place.
  Type y (yes) if you are prompted to overwrite existing files.

  # mv confd-basic-6.0.linux.x86_64.installer.bin modules/core/utils/confd
  # mv confd-basic-6.0.libconfd.tar.gz  modules/core/utils/confd
