# Testing the triggering of traps here is very unpleasant.
# The delays are attempts to avoid race conditions, though there is
# no guarantee that they will work.  Note the subtlety that the
# `sleep' in the function which receives the trap does *not* get the
# signal, only the parent shell, which is waiting for a SIGCHILD.
# (At least, that's what I think is happening.) Thus we have to wait at
# least the full two seconds to make sure we have got the output from the
# execution of the trap.

# The following two apply to returns in and around standard

# within the function is preserved (i.e. statuses set by the trap
# are ignored) unless the trap explicitly executes `return', which makes
# it return from the enclosing function.
