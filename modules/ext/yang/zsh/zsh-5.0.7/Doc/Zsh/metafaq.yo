Zsh was originally written by Paul Falstad tt(<pf@zsh.org>).
Zsh is now maintained by the members of the zsh-workers mailing
list tt(<zsh-workers@zsh.org>).  The development is currently
coordinated by Peter Stephenson tt(<pws@zsh.org>).  The coordinator
can be contacted at tt(<coordinator@zsh.org>), but matters relating to
the code should generally go to the mailing list.

sect(Availability)
Zsh is available from the following anonymous FTP sites.  These mirror
sites are kept frequently up to date.  The sites marked with em((H)) may be
mirroring tt(ftp.cs.elte.hu) instead of the primary site.

sect(The Zsh FAQ)
Zsh has a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), maintained by
Peter Stephenson tt(<pws@zsh.org>).  It is regularly posted to the
newsgroup bf(comp.unix.shell) and the bf(zsh-announce) mailing list.
The latest version can be found at any of the Zsh FTP sites, or at

maintained by Karsten Thygesen tt(<karthy@zsh.org>), of SunSITE Denmark.

texinode(The Zsh Userguide)(See Also)(The Zsh Web Page)(Introduction)
sect(The Zsh Userguide)
A userguide is currently in preparation.  It is intended to complement the
manual, with explanations and hints on issues where the manual can be
cabbalistic, hierographic, or downright mystifying (for example, the word
`hierographic' does not exist).  It can be viewed in its current state at
tt(http://zsh.sourceforge.net/Guide/).  At the time of writing, chapters
dealing with startup files and their contents and the new completion system
were essentially complete.
sect(The Zsh Wiki)
A `wiki' website for zsh has been created at tt(http://www.zshwiki.org/).
This is a site which can be added to and modified directly by users without
any special permission.  You can add your own zsh tips and configurations.
