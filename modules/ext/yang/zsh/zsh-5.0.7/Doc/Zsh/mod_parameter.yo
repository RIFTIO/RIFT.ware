COMMENT(!MOD!zsh/parameter
Access to internal hash tables via special associative arrays.
!MOD!)
cindex(parameters, special)
The tt(zsh/parameter) module gives access to some of the internal hash
tables used by the shell by defining some special parameters.

startitem()
vindex(options)
item(tt(options))(
The keys for this associative array are the names of the options that
can be set and unset using the tt(setopt) and tt(unsetopt)
builtins. The value of each key is either the string tt(on) if the
option is currently set, or the string tt(off) if the option is unset.
Setting a key to one of these strings is like setting or unsetting
the option, respectively. Unsetting a key in this array is like
setting it to the value tt(off).
)
vindex(commands)
item(tt(commands))(
This array gives access to the command hash table. The keys are the
names of external commands, the values are the pathnames of the files
that would be executed when the command would be invoked. Setting a
key in this array defines a new entry in this table in the same way as
with the tt(hash) builtin. Unsetting a key as in `tt(unset
"commands[foo]")' removes the entry for the given key from the command 
hash table.
)
vindex(functions)
item(tt(functions))(
This associative array maps names of enabled functions to their
definitions. Setting a key in it is like defining a function with the
name given by the key and the body given by the value. Unsetting a key
removes the definition for the function named by the key.
)
vindex(dis_functions)
item(tt(dis_functions))(
Like tt(functions) but for disabled functions.
)
vindex(builtins)
item(tt(builtins))(
This associative array gives information about the builtin commands
currently enabled. The keys are the names of the builtin commands and
the values are either `tt(undefined)' for builtin commands that will
automatically be loaded from a module if invoked or `tt(defined)' for
builtin commands that are already loaded.
)
vindex(dis_builtins)
item(tt(dis_builtins))(
Like tt(builtins) but for disabled builtin commands.
)
vindex(reswords)
item(tt(reswords))(
This array contains the enabled reserved words.
)
vindex(dis_reswords)
item(tt(dis_reswords))(
Like tt(reswords) but for disabled reserved words.
)
vindex(patchars)
item(tt(patchars))(
This array contains the enabled pattern characters.
)
vindex(dis_patchars)
item(tt(dis_patchars))(
Like tt(patchars) but for disabled pattern characters.
)
vindex(aliases)
item(tt(aliases))(
This maps the names of the regular aliases currently enabled to their
expansions.
)
vindex(dis_aliases)
item(tt(dis_aliases))(
Like tt(aliases) but for disabled regular aliases.
)
vindex(galiases)
item(tt(galiases))(
Like tt(aliases), but for global aliases.
)
vindex(dis_galiases)
item(tt(dis_galiases))(
Like tt(galiases) but for disabled global aliases.
)
vindex(saliases)
item(tt(saliases))(
Like tt(raliases), but for suffix aliases.
)
vindex(dis_saliases)
item(tt(dis_saliases))(
Like tt(saliases) but for disabled suffix aliases.
)
vindex(parameters)
item(tt(parameters))(
The keys in this associative array are the names of the parameters
currently defined. The values are strings describing the type of the
parameter, in the same format used by the tt(t) parameter flag, see
ifzman(\
zmanref(zshexpn)
)\
ifnzman(\
noderef(Parameter Expansion)
)\
.
Setting or unsetting keys in this array is not possible.
)
vindex(modules)
item(tt(modules))(
An associative array giving information about modules. The keys are the names
of the modules loaded, registered to be autoloaded, or aliased. The
value says which state the named module is in and is one of the
strings `tt(loaded)', `tt(autoloaded)', or `tt(alias:)var(name)',
where var(name) is the name the module is aliased to.

Setting or unsetting keys in this array is not possible.
)
vindex(dirstack)
item(tt(dirstack))(
A normal array holding the elements of the directory stack. Note that
the output of the tt(dirs) builtin command includes one more
directory, the current working directory.
)
vindex(history)
item(tt(history))(
This associative array maps history event numbers to the full history lines.
)
vindex(historywords)
item(tt(historywords))(
A special array containing the words stored in the history.
)
vindex(jobdirs)
item(tt(jobdirs))(
This associative array maps job numbers to the directories from which the
job was started (which may not be the current directory of the job).

The keys of the associative arrays are usually valid job numbers,
and these are the values output with, for example, tt(${(k)jobdirs}).
Non-numeric job references may be used when looking up a value;
for example, tt(${jobdirs[%+]}) refers to the current job.
)
vindex(jobtexts)
item(tt(jobtexts))(
This associative array maps job numbers to the texts of the command lines
that were used to start the jobs.

Handling of the keys of the associative array is as described for
tt(jobdirs) above.
)
vindex(jobstates)
item(tt(jobstates))(
This associative array gives information about the states of the jobs
currently known. The keys are the job numbers and the values are
strings of the form
`var(job-state):var(mark):var(pid)tt(=)var(state)tt(...)'. The
var(job-state) gives the state the whole job is currently in, one of
`tt(running)', `tt(suspended)', or `tt(done)'. The var(mark) is
`tt(+)' for the current job, `tt(-)' for the previous job and empty
otherwise. This is followed by one `var(pid)tt(=)var(state)' for every
process in the job. The var(pid)s are, of course, the process IDs and
the var(state) describes the state of that process.

Handling of the keys of the associative array is as described for
tt(jobdirs) above.
)
vindex(nameddirs)
item(tt(nameddirs))(
This associative array maps the names of named directories to the pathnames
they stand for.
)
vindex(userdirs)
item(tt(userdirs))(
This associative array maps user names to the pathnames of their home
directories.
)
vindex(usergroups)
item(tt(usergroups))(
This associative array maps names of system groups of which the current
user is a member to the corresponding group identifiers.  The contents
are the same as the groups output by the tt(id) command.
)
vindex(funcfiletrace)
item(tt(funcfiletrace))(
This array contains the absolute line numbers and corresponding file
names for the point where the current function, sourced file, or (if
tt(EVAL_LINENO) is set) tt(eval) command was
called.  The array is of the same length as tt(funcsourcetrace) and
tt(functrace), but differs from tt(funcsourcetrace) in that the line and
file are the point of call, not the point of definition, and differs
from tt(functrace) in that all values are absolute line numbers in
files, rather than relative to the start of a function, if any.
)
vindex(funcsourcetrace)
item(tt(funcsourcetrace))(
This array contains the file names and line numbers of the
points where the functions, sourced files, and (if tt(EVAL_LINENO) is set)
tt(eval) commands currently being executed were
defined.  The line number is the line where the `tt(function) var(name)'
or `var(name) tt(LPAR()RPAR())' started.  In the case of an autoloaded
function  the line number is reported as zero.
The format of each element is var(filename)tt(:)var(lineno).
For functions autoloaded from a file in native zsh format, where only the
body of the function occurs in the file, or for files that have been
executed by the tt(source) or `tt(.)' builtins, the trace information is
shown as var(filename)tt(:)var(0), since the entire file is the definition.

Most users will be interested in the information in the
tt(funcfiletrace) array instead.
)
vindex(funcstack)
item(tt(funcstack))(
This array contains the names of the functions, sourced files,
and (if tt(EVAL_LINENO) is set) tt(eval) commands. currently being
executed. The first element is the name of the function using the
parameter.

The standard shell array tt(zsh_eval_context) can be used to
determine the type of shell construct being executed at each depth:
note, however, that is in the opposite order, with the most recent
item last, and it is more detailed, for example including an
entry for tt(toplevel), the main shell code being executed
either interactively or from a script, which is not present
in tt($funcstack).
)
vindex(functrace)
item(tt(functrace))(
This array contains the names and line numbers of the callers
corresponding to the functions currently being executed.
The format of each element is var(name)tt(:)var(lineno).
Callers are also shown for sourced files; the caller is the point
where the tt(source) or `tt(.)' command was executed.
