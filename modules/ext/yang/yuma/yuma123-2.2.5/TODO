This file contains the list of known items not finished in the source code.
They should be added to the bug tracker.
  -- Docs
    -- Design spec
    -- Doxygen
  -- Makefiles
    -- need automated regression tests (make test)
    -- automake and autoconf need to replace platform/*
    -- support for Windows needed
    -- MAC fink packaging not done
  -- yangdump
   -- comments are not translated at all; they are always discarded
   -- ncx:cli YANG convert to unix man files
   -- ietf validation mode not supported
   -- YANG to xml2rfc not supported
   -- XSD translation:  
   -- HTML generation:
      -- JQuery menu not supported
   -- SIL code generation not done:
     -- RPC output
     -- support for NCX_ERR_SKIPPED to PASS callback to parent
        partially handled (or skipped)
     -- conditional code generation for features and the CLI
        parms for this functionality is not done
     -- when-stmt auto-gen code is not done
  -- yangcli to-do:
     -- replace libtecla with readline
     -- command completion for more data types
     -- command completion based on mirror of database
  -- server bugs:
    -- ietf-netconf.yang not used internally.  hacks are used
       to advertise ietf-netconf but use yuma-netconf.
       An 'annotation' feature like deviation-stmt is needed
       to split out the implementation extensions and other
       YANG statements from the standard module.
    -- features are not advertised for ietf-netconf, 
       just capabilities
    -- openssh client hello bug: the client hello code is not
       used; not sure why the SSH application timeout occurs even
       if there is NETCONF traffic; must be doing something
       wrong in the client or server SSH code.
    -- load module chicken-and-egg bug:
      - load a module dynamically and then save some config in
        in the newly loaded module namespace.  Since there is no
        'load foo' added to the netconfd CLI or .conf file,
        this new config will be treated as unknown namespace error
        on the next reboot
    -- SIL user callback functions do not yet support a 'PASS' mode,
       so that multiple callback handlers within the same YANG
       data structure can be utilized.  
  -- server optimizations not done:
    -- save to NVstore:
      -- user hook to override output to XML file
      -- write /config/foo in sub-directories instead of
         XML. Start the XML file(s) for the next layer.
         /config/foo/bar.xml
