The Tecla library was written with portability in mind, so no
modifications to the source code should be needed on UNIX or LINUX
platforms. The default compilation and linking arrangements should
also work unchanged on these systems, but if no specific configuration
has been provided for your system, shared libraries won't be compiled.
Configuring these requires modifications to be made to the file:

  configure.in

This file is heavily commented (comments start with the word dnl) and
is relatively simple, so the instructions and suggestions that you
find in this file should be sufficient to help you figure out how to
add a configuration for your system. This file is an input file to the
GNU autoconf program, which uses it as a template for generating the
distributed configure script. If autoconf is installed on your system,
creating a new configure script is a simple matter of typing.

  autoconf

To avoid confusion with the leftovers of the previous configuration,
you should then do the following:

 rm -f config.cache
 ./configure
 make clean
 ./configure
 make

The first ./configure creates a new makefile for your system, allowing
you to type 'make clean' to discard any files that were compiled with
the previous configuration. Since 'make clean' also deletes the new
makefile, a second invokation of the configure script is then
performed to re-create the makefile. The final make then creates the
tecla library from scratch.

Once you have confirmed that the new configuration works, please send
the modified "configure.in" template to mcs@astro.caltech.edu, so that
your changes can be included in subsequent releases.
