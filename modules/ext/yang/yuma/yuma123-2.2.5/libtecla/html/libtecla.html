</pre><h2>NAME</h2><pre>
       libtecla - An interactive command-line input library.

</pre><h2>SYNOPSIS</h2><pre>
       @CC@ ... -ltecla -lcurses


</pre><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><pre>
       The tecla library provides programs with interactive command line edit-
       ing facilities, similar to those of the unix tcsh shell. In addition to
       simple  command-line  editing, it supports recall of previously entered
       command lines, TAB completion of file names or other  tokens,  and  in-
       line  wild-card  expansion  of  filenames. The internal functions which
       perform file-name completion and wild-card expansion are also available
       externally for optional use by the calling program.

       The  various  parts  of the library are documented in the following man
       pages:

                               command-line editing facilities
                               provided by gl_get_line().
         <a href="gl_get_line.html"><b>gl_get_line</b></a>        -  The interactive line-input module.

         <a href="cpl_complete_word.html"><b>cpl_complete_word</b></a>  -  The word completion module.
         <a href="ef_expand_file.html"><b>ef_expand_file</b></a>     -  The filename expansion module.

                               lookup and completion module.

       In addition there is one  optional  application  distributed  with  the
       library:

</pre><h2>THREAD SAFETY</h2><pre>
       If  the  library  is compiled with -D_POSIX_C_SOURCE=199506L, reentrant
       versions of as many functions as possible are used. This includes using
       getpwuid_r() and getpwnam_r() instead of getpwuid() and getpwnam() when
       looking up the home directories of specific users in the password  file
       (for  ~user/ expansion), and readdir_r() instead of readdir() for read-
       ing directory entries when doing  filename  completion.  The  reentrant
       version of the library is usually called libtecla_r.a instead of libte-
       cla.a, so if only the latter is available, it probably isn't  the  cor-
       rect version to link with threaded programs.

       Reentrant  functions  for  iterating  through  the password file aren't
       available, so when the library is compiled to be reentrant, TAB comple-
       tion  of  incomplete  usernames  in ~username/ expressions is disabled.
       This doesn't disable expansion of complete ~username expressions, which
       can  be  done  reentrantly, or expansion of the parts of filenames that
       follow them, so this doesn't remove much functionality.

       The terminfo functions setupterm(), tigetstr(), tigetnum() and  tputs()
       also aren't reentrant, but very few programs will want to interact with
       multiple terminals, so this shouldn't prevent this library  from  being
       used in threaded programs.


</pre><h2>LIBRARY VERSION NUMBER</h2><pre>
       The  version  number  of the library can be queried using the following
       function.

        void libtecla_version(int *major, int *minor, int *micro);


       On return, this function records the three components of  the  libtecla
       version  number  in  *major,  *minor, *micro. The formal meaning of the
       three components is as follows.


        major - Incrementing this number implies that a change has
                been made to the library's public interface, which
                makes it binary incompatible  with programs that
                were linked with previous shared versions of the
                tecla library.

        minor - This number is incremented by one whenever
                additional functionality, such as new functions or
                modules, are added to the library.

        micro - This is incremented whenever modifications to the
                library are made which make no changes to the
                public interface, but which fix bugs and/or improve
                the behind-the-scenes implementation.



</pre><h2>TRIVIA</h2><pre>
       In Spanish, a "tecla" is the key of a keyboard. Since this library cen-
       ters  on  keyboard  input,  and  given that I wrote much of the library
       while working in Chile, this seemed like a suitable name.


</pre><h2>FILES</h2><pre>

       libtecla.h    -   The tecla header file.
       ~/.teclarc    -   The tecla personal customization file.
