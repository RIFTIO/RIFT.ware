</pre><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><pre>
       The gl_get_line() function,  which  is  documented  separately  in  the
       <a href="gl_get_line.html"><b>gl_get_line</b></a>  man page, supports two different I/O modes.
       These are selected by calling the gl_io_mode() function.


         int gl_io_mode(GetLine *gl, GlIOMode mode);


       The mode argument of this function specifies the new I/O mode, and must
       be one of the following.


         GL_NORMAL_MODE   -  Select the normal blocking-I/O mode.
                             In this mode gl_get_line()
                             doesn't return until either an error
                             occurs of the user finishes entering a
                             new line. This mode is the focus of
                             the <a href="gl_get_line.html"><b>gl_get_line</b></a> man page.

         GL_SERVER_MODE   -  Select non-blocking server I/O mode.
                             In this mode, since non-blocking
                             terminal I/O is used, the entry of
                             each new input line typically requires
                             many calls to gl_get_line() from
                             an external I/O-driven event loop.
                             This mode is the focus of this man
                             page.


       Newly created GetLine objects start in normal I/O mode, so to switch to
       non-blocking server mode requires an initial call to gl_io_mode().


</pre><h2>SERVER I/O MODE</h2><pre>
       In non-blocking server I/O mode, the application is required to have an
       event  loop  which  calls  gl_get_line()  whenever  the  terminal  file
       descriptor can do the type I/O that gl_get_line() is  waiting  for.  To
       determine  which type of I/O gl_get_line() is waiting for, the applica-
       tion calls the gl_pending_io() function.


         GlPendingIO gl_pending_io(GetLine *gl);


       The return value of this function is one of the following  two  enumer-
       ated values.


         GLP_READ    -  gl_get_line() is waiting to write a
                        character to the terminal.

         GLP_WRITE   -  gl_get_line() is waiting to read a
                        character from the keyboad.


       If  the application is using either the select() or poll() system calls
       to watch for I/O on a group of file descriptors, then  it  should  call
       the gl_pending_io() function before each call to these functions to see
       which direction of I/O it should tell them to watch for, and  configure
       their  arguments  accordingly. In the case of the select() system call,
       this means using the FD_SET() macro to add the terminal file descriptor
       either to the set of file descriptors to be watched for readability, or
       the set to be watched for writability.

       As in normal I/O mode, the return value of gl_get_line()  is  either  a
       pointer  to a completed input line, or NULL. However, whereas in normal
       I/O mode a NULL return value always means that an  error  occurred,  in
       non-blocking  server  mode,  NULL  is  also returned when gl_get_line()
       can't read or write to the terminal  without  blocking.  Thus  in  non-
       blocking  server  mode,  in order to determine when a NULL return value
       signifies that an error occurred or not, it is necessary  to  call  the
       gl_return_status()  function.  If  this function returns the enumerated
       value, GLR_BLOCKED, as documented in the <a href="gl_get_line.html"><b>gl_get_line</b></a> man
       page,  this  means  that gl_get_line() is waiting for I/O, and no error
       has occurred.

       When gl_get_line() returns NULL and gl_return_status()  indicates  that
       this  is  due  to  blocked  terminal  I/O,  the application should call
       gl_get_line() again when the type of I/O  reported  by  gl_pending_io()
       becomes  possible.  The  prompt,  start_line and start_pos arguments of
       gl_get_line() will be ignored on these calls.  If you  need  to  change
       the  prompt  of  the  line that is currently being edited, then you can
       call   the   gl_replace_prompt()   function    (documented    in    the
       <a href="gl_get_line.html"><b>gl_get_line</b></a> man page) between calls to gl_get_line().


</pre><h2>GIVING UP THE TERMINAL</h2><pre>
       A  complication  that  is unique to non-blocking server mode is that it
       requires that the terminal  be  left  in  raw  mode  between  calls  to
       gl_get_line().  If  this  weren't  the  case,  the  external event loop
       wouldn't be able to detect individual key-presses, and the  basic  line
       editing implemented by the terminal driver would clash with the editing
       provided by gl_get_line(). What this means is that any  time  that  the
       terminal  needs  to  be used for other things than entering a new input
       line with gl_get_line(), it needs to be restored to a usable state.  In
       particular, whenever the process is suspended or terminated, the termi-
       nal must be returned to a  normal  state.  If  this  isn't  done,  then
       depending  on  the characteristics of the shell that was used to invoke
       the program, the user may end up with a hung terminal. To this end, the
       gl_normal_io()  function is provided for switching the terminal back to
       the state that it was in when raw mode was last established.


         int gl_normal_io(GetLine *gl);


       What this function does is first flush any pending output to the termi-
       nal,  then move the cursor to the start of the terminal line which fol-
       lows the end of the incompletely entered input line. At this  point  it
       is  safe  to  suspend  or terminate the process, and it is safe for the
       application to read and write to the terminal. To resume entry  of  the
       input line, the application should call the gl_raw_io() function.


         int gl_raw_io(GetLine *gl);


       This  function  starts  a  new line, redisplays the partially completed
       input line (if any), restores the cursor position within this  line  to
       where it was when gl_normal_io() was called, then switches back to raw,
       non-blocking terminal mode ready to continue entry of  the  input  line
       when gl_get_line() is next called.

       Note that in non-blocking server mode, if gl_get_line() is called after
       a call to gl_normal_io(), without an intervening call  to  gl_raw_io(),
       gl_get_line()  will  call  gl_raw_mode()  itself, and the terminal will
       remain in this mode when gl_get_line() returns.


</pre><h2>SIGNAL HANDLING</h2><pre>
       In the previous section it was pointed out that in non-blocking  server
       mode,  the  terminal must be restored to a sane state whenever a signal
       is received that either suspends or terminates the process.  In  normal
       I/O  mode,  this  is done for you by gl_get_line(), but in non-blocking
       server mode, since the terminal is left in raw mode  between  calls  to
       gl_get_line(),  this signal handling has to be done by the application.
       Since there are many signals that can suspend or terminate  a  process,
       as  well  as other signals that are important to gl_get_line(), such as
       the SIGWINCH signal, which tells it when the terminal size has changed,
       the  gl_tty_signals()  function  is provided for installing signal han-
       dlers for all pertinent signals.


         int gl_tty_signals(void (*term_handler)(int),
                            void (*susp_handler)(int),
                            void (*cont_handler)(int),
                            void (*size_handler)(int));


       What this does is use  gl_get_line()'s  internal  list  of  signals  to
       assign specified signal handlers to groups of signals. The arguments of
       this function are as follows.


         term_handler  -  This is the signal handler that is to be
                          used to trap signals that by default
                          terminate any process that receives
                          them (eg. SIGINT or SIGTERM).

         susp_handler  -  This is the signal handler that is to be
                          used to trap signals that by default
                          suspend any process that receives them,
                          (eg. SIGTSTP or SIGTTOU).

         cont_handler  -  This is the signal handler that is to be
                          used to trap signals that are usually
                          sent when a process resumes after being
                          suspended (usually SIGCONT). Beware that there is
                          nothing to stop a user from sending one of these
                          signals at other times.

         size_handler  -  This signal handler is used to trap
                          signals that are sent to processes when
                          their controlling terminals are resized
                          by the user (eg. SIGWINCH).


       These arguments can all be the same, if so desired, and you can specify
       SIG_IGN  (ignore  this  signal)  or  SIG_DFL  (use  the system-provided
       default signal handler) instead of a function where pertinent. In  par-
       ticular, it is rarely useful to trap SIGCONT, so the cont_handler argu-
       ment will usually be SIG_DFL or SIG_IGN.

       The gl_tty_signals() function uses the POSIX  sigaction()  function  to
       install  these  signal  handlers,  and it is careful to use the sa_mask
       member of each sigaction structure to ensure that  only  one  of  these
       signals  is  ever  delivered  at  a time. This guards against different
       instances of these signal handlers from simultaneously trying to  write
       to common global data, such as a shared sigsetjmp() buffer or a signal-
       received flag.

       The signal handlers that are installed by this  function,  should  call
       the gl_handle_signal().


         void gl_handle_signal(int signo, GetLine *gl, int ngl);


       The  signo  argument tells this function which signal it is being asked
       to respond to, and the gl argument should be a  pointer  to  the  first
       element  of  an  array of ngl GetLine objects. If your application only
       has one of these objects, just pass its pointer as the gl argument  and
       specify ngl as 1.

       Depending  on the signal that is being handled, this function does dif-
       ferent things.


   Terminal resize signals (SIGWINCH)
       If the signal indicates that the terminal was resized, then it arranges
       for the next call to gl_get_line() to ask the terminal for its new size
       and redraw the input line accordingly. In order that  gl_get_line()  be
       called as soon as possible to do this, gl_handle_signal() also arranges
       that the next call to gl_pending_io() will return  GLP_WRITE.  Thus  if
       the  application waits for I/O in select() or poll(), then the applica-
       tion needs to ensure that these functions will be reliably aborted when
       a  signal is caught and handled by the application. More on this below.


</pre><h2>Process termination signals.</h2><pre>
       If the signal that was caught is one of those that  by  default  termi-
       nates  any  process  that receives it, then gl_handle_signal() does the
       following steps.

       1. First it blocks the delivery of all signals that can be
          blocked (ie. SIGKILL and SIGSTOP can't be blocked)

       2. Next it calls gl_normal_io() for each of the ngl
          GetLine objects. Note that this does nothing to any of the
          GetLine objects that aren't currently in raw mode.

       3. Next it sets the signal handler of the signal to its default,
          process-termination disposition.

       4. Next it re-sends the process the signal that was caught.

       5. Finally it unblocks delivery of this signal, which
          results in the process being terminated.


</pre><h2>Process suspension signals.</h2><pre>
       If the default disposition of the signal is to suspend the process, the
       same steps are executed as for process termination signals, except that
       when the process is later resumed,  gl_handle_signal()  continues,  and
       does the following steps.

       6. It re-blocks delivery of the signal.

       7. It reinstates the signal handler of the signal to the one
          that was displaced when its default disposition was substituted.

       8. For any of the GetLine objects that were in raw mode when
          gl_handle_signal() was called, gl_handle_signal() then
          calls gl_raw_io(), to resume entry of the input lines on
          those terminals.

       9. Finally, it restores the signal process mask to how it
          was when gl_handle_signal() was called.

       Note  that  the  process  is suspended or terminated using the original
       signal that was caught, rather than using the uncatchable  SIGSTOP  and
       SIGKILL signals. This is important, because when a process is suspended
       or terminated, the parent of the process may wish  to  use  the  status
       value returned by the wait() system call to figure out which signal was
       responsible. In particular, most shells use this information to print a
       corresponding  message to the terminal. Users would be rightly confused
       if when their process received a SIGPIPE signal, the program  responded
       by  sending itself a SIGKILL signal, and the shell then printed out the
       provocative statement, "Killed!".


</pre><h2>INTERRUPTING THE EVENT LOOP</h2><pre>
       If a signal is caught and handled when the application's event loop  is
       waiting  in  select()  or  poll(), these functions will be aborted with
       errno set to EINTR. When  this  happens  the  event  loop  should  call
       gl_pending_io(),  before  calling  select()  or poll() again. It should
       then arrange for select() or poll() to wait for the type  of  I/O  that
       this reports. This is necessary, because any signal handler which calls
       gl_handle_signal(),  will  frequently  change  the  type  of  I/O  that
       gl_get_line() is waiting for.

       Unfortunately, if a signal arrives between the statements which config-
       ure the arguments of select() or poll() and the calls  to  these  func-
       tions,  then the signal will not be seen by these functions, which will
       then not be aborted. If these functions are waiting for keyboard  input
       from  the  user  when  the  signal  is received, and the signal handler
       arranges to redraw the input line to accomodate a  terminal  resize  or
       the resumption of the process, then this redisplay will be end up being
       delayed until the user hits the next key. Apart from puzzling the user,
       this  clearly  isn't  a serious problem. However there is a way, albeit
       complicated, to completely avoid this  race  condition.  The  following
       steps illustrate this.

       1. Block all of the signals that gl_get_line() catches,
          by passing the signal set returned by gl_list_signals() to
          sigprocmask().

       2. Call gl_pending_io() and set up the arguments of
          select() or poll() accordingly.

       3. Call sigsetjmp() with a non-zero savesigs argument.

       4. Initially this sigsetjmp() statement will return zero,
          indicating that control isn't resuming there after a matching
          call to siglongjmp().

       5. Replace all of the handlers of the signals that gl_get_line()
          is configured to catch, with a signal handler that first records
          the number of the signal that was caught, in a file-scope variable,
          then calls siglongjmp() with a non-zero value argument, to
          return execution to the above sigsetjmp()
          statement.  Registering these signal handlers can conveniently be
          done using the gl_tty_signals() function.

       6. Set the file-scope variable that the above signal handler uses to
          record any signal that is caught to -1, so that we can check
          whether a signal was caught by seeing if it contains a valid signal
          number.

       7. Now unblock the signals that were blocked in step 1. Any signal
          that was received by the process in between step 1 and now will
          now be delivered, and trigger our signal handler, as will any
          signal that is received until we block these signals again.

       8. Now call select() or poll().

       9. When select() returns, again block the signals that were
          unblocked in step 7.

       If a signal is arrived any time during the above steps, our signal han-
       dler will be triggered and cause control to return to  the  sigsetjmp()
       statement,  where this time, sigsetjmp() will return non-zero, indicat-
       ing that a signal was caught. When this  happens  we  simply  skip  the
       above  block of statements, and continue with the following statements,
       which are executed regardless of whether or not  a  signal  is  caught.
       Note  that when sigsetjmp() returns, regardless of why it returned, the
       process signal mask is returned to how  it  was  when  sigsetjmp()  was
       called.  Thus  the following statements are always executed with all of
       our signals blocked.

       9. Reinstate the signal handlers that were displaced in step 5.

       10. Check wether a signal was caught, by checking the file-scope
           variable that the signal handler records signal numbers in.

       11. If a signal was caught, send this signal to the application
           again, and unblock just this signal, so that it invokes the
           signal handler which we just reinstated in step 10.

       12. Unblock all of the signals that were blocked in step 7.

       Since this is complicated, note that demo3.c includes a working example
       of  how to do this. The method used there however, is more general than
       the above. What it provides is a wrapper function around select() which
       encompasses   steps   3  to  11.  In  this  wrapper,  rather  than  use
       gl_list_signals()  to  figure  out  the  signals  to  block,  and   and
       gl_tty_signals() to assign and revert signal handlers, one of its argu-
       ments is a sigset_t which specifies which signals to block  and  assign
       signal  handlers to. This function thus doesn't depend on gl_get_line()
       and can thus be used in other situations where race-condition-free sig-
       nal handling is required.


</pre><h2>SIGNALS CAUGHT BY GL_GET_LINE</h2><pre>
       Since  the  application  is  expected to handle signals in non-blocking
       server mode, gl_get_line() doesn't attempt to duplicate this when it is
       being  called.  If one of the signals that it is configured to catch is
       sent  to  the  application  while  gl_get_line()   is   being   called,
       gl_get_line() reinstates the caller's signal handlers, then just before
       returning, re-sends the signal to the process to let the  application's
       signal  handler handle it. If the process isn't terminated by this sig-
       nal, gl_get_line() returns NULL, and a following call to gl_return_sta-
       tus() returns the enumerated value GLR_SIGNAL.


</pre><h2>ABORTING LINE INPUT</h2><pre>
       Often,  rather  than  letting  it  terminate  the process, applications
       respond to the SIGINT user-interrupt signal  by  aborting  the  current
       input  line.  The  way to do this in non-blocking server-I/O mode is to
       not call gl_handle_signal() when this signal is caught, but instead  to
       call the gl_abandon_line().


         void gl_abandon_line(GetLine *gl);


       This function arranges that when gl_get_line() is next called, it first
       flushes any pending output to the terminal, then discardes the  current
       input  line,  outputs a new prompt on the next line, and finally starts
       accepting input of a new input line from the user.


</pre><h2>SIGNAL SAFE FUNCTIONS</h2><pre>
       Provided that certain rules are followed, the following  functions  can
       have  been  written  to  be safely callable from signal handlers. Other
       functions in this library should not be called from signal handlers.


         gl_normal_io()
         gl_raw_io()
         gl_handle_signal()
         gl_abandon_line()


       In order for this to be true, all signal handlers that call these func-
       tions  must  be  registered in such a way that only one instance of any
       one of them can be running at one time. The way to do this  is  to  use
       the  POSIX  sigaction()  function  to register all signal handlers, and
       when doing this, use the sa_mask member of the corresponding  sigaction
       structure,  to  indicate  that all of the signals who's handlers invoke
       the above functions, should be blocked when the current signal is being
       handled.  This prevents two signal handlers from operating on a GetLine
       object at the same time.

       To prevent signal  handlers  from  accessing  a  GetLine  object  while
       gl_get_line()  or  any of its associated public functions are operating
       on it, all public functions associated  with  gl_get_line(),  including
       gl_get_line()  itself,  temporarily  block the delivery of signals when
       they are accessing GetLine objects. Beware that the only  signals  that
       they  block  are the signals that gl_get_line() is currently configured
       to catch, so be sure that if you call any of the above  functions  from
       signal  handlers,  that the signals that these handlers are assigned to
       are configured to be caught by gl_get_line() (see gl_trap_signal()).


</pre><h2>USING TIMEOUTS TO POLL</h2><pre>
       If instead of using select() or poll() to wait for I/O,  your  applica-
       tion  just needs to get out of gl_get_line() periodically to briefly do
       something else before returning to accept input from the user, this can
       be  done  in  non-blocking server mode by using the gl_inactivity_time-
       out() function (see  <a href="gl_get_line.html"><b>gl_get_line</b></a>),  to  specify  that  a
       callback  function that returns GLTO_CONTINUE should be called whenever
       gl_get_line() has been waiting for I/O for more than a specified amount
       of time.

       When  this callback is triggered, gl_get_line() will return NULL, and a
       following call to gl_return_status() will return GLR_BLOCKED.

       Beware that gl_get_line() won't return until the user  hasn't  typed  a
       key  for  the  specified  interval, so if the interval is long, and the
       user keeps typing, gl_get_line() may not return for a while.  In  other
       words  there is no guarantee that it will return in the time specified.


</pre><h2>THE SERVER DEMO PROGRAM</h2><pre>
       The demo3 program that is distributed  with  the  library,  provides  a
       working  example  of  how to use non-blocking server I/O mode in a real
       program. As far  as  the  user  is  concerned,  this  program  operates
       identically to the main demo program (called demo), except that whereas
       the main demo program uses the normal blocking I/O  mode,  demo3  using
       non-blocking  I/O  and  an  external event loop. The source code can be
       found in demo3.c, and the comments therein explain the various steps.
