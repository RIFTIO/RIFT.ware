</pre><h2>NAME</h2><pre>
       tecla, teclarc - The user interface provided by the Tecla library.

</pre><h2>DESCRIPTION</h2><pre>
       This  man  page  describes  the  command-line editing features that are
       available to users of programs that read keyboard input via  the  Tecla
       library.  Users  of  the  tcsh shell will find the default key-bindings
       very familiar. Users of the bash shell will also find it  quite  famil-
       iar,  but with a few minor differences, most notably in how forward and
       backward searches through the list  of  historical  commands  are  per-
       formed.  There  are  two  major editing modes, one with emacs-like key-
       bindings and another with vi-like key-bindings. By default  emacs  mode
       is  enabled,  but  vi mode can alternatively be selected via the user's
       configuration file. This file can also be used to change  the  bindings
       of individual keys to suit the user's preferences. By default, tab com-
       pletion is provided. If the application  hasn't  reconfigured  this  to
       complete  other  types  of symbols, then tab completion completes file-
       names.


</pre><h2>KEY SEQUENCE NOTATION</h2><pre>
       In the rest of this man page,  and  also  in  all  Tecla  configuration
       files, key-sequences are expressed as follows.


       ^A  or  C-a
           This is a control-A, entered by pressing the control key at
           the same time as the A key.

       \E    or   M-
           In key-sequences, both of these notations can be entered
           either by pressing the escape key, then the following key, or by
           pressing the Meta key at the same time as the following key. Thus
           the key sequence M-p can be typed in two ways, by pressing
           the escape key, followed by pressing p, or by pressing the
           Meta key at the same time as p.

       up
           This refers to the up-arrow key.

       down
           This refers to the down-arrow key.

       left
           This refers to the left-arrow key.

       right
           This refers to the right-arrow key.

       a
           This is just a normal A key.



</pre><h2>THE TECLA CONFIGURATION FILE</h2><pre>
       By  default, Tecla looks for a file called .teclarc in your home direc-
       tory (ie. ~/.teclarc).  If it finds this file, it reads it,  interpret-
       ing each line as defining a new key binding or an editing configuration
       option. Since the emacs keybindings are installed by  default,  if  you
       want to use the non-default vi editing mode, the most important item to
       go in this file is the following line:

         edit-mode vi

       This will re-configure the default bindings for vi-mode.  The  complete
       set of arguments that this command accepts are:

         vi     -  Install key-bindings like those of the vi
                   editor.
         emacs  -  Install key-bindings like those of the emacs
                   editor. This is the default.
         none   -  Use just the native line editing facilities
                   provided by the terminal driver.

       To  prevent the terminal bell from being rung, such as when an unrecog-
       nized control-sequence is typed, place the following line in  the  con-
       figuration file:

         nobeep

       An  example of a key binding line in the configuration file is the fol-
       lowing.

         bind M-[2~ insert-mode

       On many keyboards, the above key sequence is generated when one presses
       the  insert  key,  so  with this keybinding, one can toggle between the
       emacs-mode insert and overwrite modes by hitting  one  key.  One  could
       also  do  it by typing out the above sequence of characters one by one.
       As explained above, the M- part of this sequence can be typed either by
       pressing  the  escape  key before the following key, or by pressing the
       Meta key at the same time as the following key. Thus if you had set the
       above  key binding, and the insert key on your keyboard didn't generate
       the above key sequence, you could still type it in either of  the  fol-
       lowing 2 ways.

         1. Hit the escape key momentarily, then press '[', then '2', then
            finally '~'.

         2. Press the meta key at the same time as pressing the '[' key,
            then press '2', then '~'.

       If  you  set a keybinding for a key-sequence that is already bound to a
       function, the new binding overrides the old one. If in the new  binding
       you  omit the name of the new function to bind to the key-sequence, the
       original binding becomes undefined.

       Starting with versions of libtecla later than 1.3.3 it is now  possible
       to  bind keysequences that begin with a printable character. Previously
       key-sequences were required to start with a control or meta  character.

       Note  that  the special keywords "up", "down", "left" and "right" refer
       to the arrow keys, and are thus not treated as  keysequences.  So,  for
       example, to rebind the up and down arrow keys to use the history search
       mechanism instead of the simple history recall method, you could  place
       the following in your configuration file:

         bind up history-search-backwards
         bind down history-search-backwards

       To unbind an existing binding, you can do this with the bind command by
       omitting to name any action to rebind the key sequence to.   For  exam-
       ple,  by  not  specifying  an  action  function,  the following command
       unbinds the default beginning-of-line action from the ^A key sequence:

         bind ^A

       If you create a ~/.teclarc configuration file, but it appears  to  have
       no effect on the program, check the documentation of the program to see
       if the author chose a different name for this file.


</pre><h2>FILENAME AND TILDE COMPLETION</h2><pre>
       With the default key bindings, pressing the TAB key (aka.  ^I)  results
       in  Tecla  attempting to complete the incomplete filename that precedes
       the cursor. Tecla searches backwards from the cursor, looking  for  the
       start  of  the  filename,  stopping  when it hits either a space or the
       start of the line. If more than one file has the specified prefix, then
       Tecla  completes  the  filename  up to the point at which the ambiguous
       matches start to differ, then lists the possible matches.

       In addition to literally written filenames, Tecla  can  complete  files
       that  start  with  ~/  and  ~user/ expressions and that contain $envvar
       expressions. In particular, if you hit TAB within an incomplete  ~user,
       expression,  Tecla  will  attempt to complete the username, listing any
       ambiguous matches.

       The completion binding is implemented using the  cpl_word_completions()
       function,  which is also available separately to users of this library.
       See the cpl_word_completions(@LIBR_MANEXT@) man page for more  details.


</pre><h2>FILENAME EXPANSION</h2><pre>
       With  the default key bindings, pressing ^X* causes Tecla to expand the
       filename that precedes the cursor, replacing ~/ and ~user/  expressions
       with  the corresponding home directories, and replacing $envvar expres-
       sions with the value of the specified  environment  variable,  then  if
       there  are any wildcards, replacing the so far expanded filename with a
       space-separated list of the files which match the wild cards.

       The expansion binding is implemented using the  ef_expand_file()  func-
       tion.  See the <a href="ef_expand_file.html"><b>ef_expand_file</b></a> man page for more details.


</pre><h2>RECALLING PREVIOUSLY TYPED LINES</h2><pre>
       Every time that a new line is entered by the user, it is appended to  a
       list  of  historical input lines maintained within the GetLine resource
       object. You can traverse up and down this list using the  up  and  down
       arrow  keys.  Alternatively,  you  can  do the same with the ^P, and ^N
       keys, and in vi command mode you can alternatively  use  the  k  and  j
       characters.  Thus  pressing  up-arrow  once, replaces the current input
       line  with  the  previously  entered  line.  Pressing  up-arrow  again,
       replaces  this  with  the line that was entered before it, etc.. Having
       gone back one or more lines into the history list, one  can  return  to
       newer  lines  by  pressing down-arrow one or more times. If you do this
       sufficient times, you will return to the original line  that  you  were
       entering when you first hit up-arrow.

       Note  that  in  vi mode, all of the history recall functions switch the
       library into command mode.

       In emacs mode the M-p and M-n keys work just like the ^P and  ^N  keys,
       except  that  they  skip all but those historical lines which share the
       prefix that precedes the cursor. In vi command mode the  upper  case  K
       and  J  characters  do the same thing, except that the string that they
       search for includes the character under the cursor as well as what pre-
       cedes it.

       Thus for example, suppose that you were in emacs mode, and you had just
       entered the following list of commands in the order shown:

         ls ~/tecla/
         cd ~/tecla
         ls -l getline.c
         emacs ~/tecla/getline.c

       If you next typed:

         ls

       and then hit M-p, then rather than returning the previously typed emacs
       line, which doesn't start with "ls", Tecla would recall the "ls -l get-
       line.c" line. Pressing M-p again would recall the "ls ~/tecla/" line.

       Note that if the string that you are searching for, contains any of the
       special  characters, *, ?, or '[', then it is interpretted as a pattern
       to be matched. Thus, cotinuing with the above example, after typing  in
       the list of commands shown, if you then typed:

         *tecla*

       and  hit M-p, then the "emacs ~/tecla/getline.c" line would be recalled
       first, since it contains the word tecla somewhere in  the  line,  Simi-
       larly, hitting M-p again, would recall the "ls ~/tecla/" line, and hit-
       ting it once more would recall the "ls ~/tecla/" line. The pattern syn-
       tax  is  the  same  as  that  described  for filename expansion, in the
       ef_expand_file(@LIBR_MANEXT@ man page.


</pre><h2>HISTORY FILES</h2><pre>
       Authors of programs that use the Tecla library have the option of  sav-
       ing historical command-lines in a file before exiting, and subsequently
       reading them back in from this file when the program is  next  started.
       There  is no standard name for this file, since it makes sense for each
       application to use its own history file, so that commands from  differ-
       ent applications don't get mixed up.


</pre><h2>INTERNATIONAL CHARACTER SETS</h2><pre>
       Since  libtecla  version  1.4.0, Tecla has been 8-bit clean. This means
       that all 8-bit characters that are  printable  in  the  user's  current
       locale  are  now  displayed verbatim and included in the returned input
       line.  Assuming that the calling program correctly contains a call like
       the following,

         setlocale(LC_CTYPE, "");

       then  the  current locale is determined by the first of the environment
       variables LC_CTYPE, LC_ALL, and LANG, that is found to contain a  valid
       locale  name.  If  none  of these variables are defined, or the program
       neglects to call setlocale, then the default C locale is used, which is
       US  7-bit  ASCII.  On  most  unix-like platforms, you can get a list of
       valid locales by typing the command:

         locale -a

       at the shell prompt.


   Meta keys and locales
       Beware that in most locales other than the default C locale, meta char-
       acters  become  printable,  and  they  are then no longer considered to
       match M-c style key bindings. This allows international  characters  to
       be  entered  with  the compose key without unexpectedly triggering meta
       key bindings. You can still invoke meta bindings, since there are actu-
       ally  two  ways  to  do  this.  For example the binding M-c can also be
       invoked by pressing the escape key momentarily,  then  pressing  the  c
       key,  and  this  will  work regardless of locale. Moreover, many modern
       terminal emulators, such as gnome's gnome-terminal's and KDE's  konsole
       terminals,  already  generate  escape  pairs like this when you use the
       meta key, rather than a real meta character, and other  emulators  usu-
       ally  have  a  way to request this behavior, so you can continue to use
       the meta key on most systems.

       For example, although xterm terminal emulators generate real 8-bit meta
       characters by default when you use the meta key, they can be configured
       to output the equivalent escape pair by setting their  EightBitInput  X
       resource  to  False.  You can either do this by placing a line like the
       following in your ~/.Xdefaults file,

         XTerm*EightBitInput: False

       or by starting an xterm with an -xrm '*EightBitInput:  False'  command-
       line  argument. In recent versions of xterm you can toggle this feature
       on and off with the "Meta Sends Escape" option in the menu that is dis-
       played  when you press the left mouse button and the control key within
       an xterm window. In CDE, dtterms can be similarly coerced  to  generate
       escape pairs in place of meta characters, by setting the Dtterm*KshMode
       resource to True.


   Entering international characters
       If you don't have a keyboard that generates all  of  the  international
       characters  that  you  need,  there  is usually a compose key that will
       allow you to enter special characters, or a  way  to  create  one.  For
       example, under X windows on unix-like systems, if your keyboard doesn't
       have a compose key, you can designate a redundant  key  to  serve  this
       purpose  with  the  xmodmap  command. For example, on many PC keyboards
       there is a microsoft-windows key,  which  is  otherwise  useless  under
       Linux. On my laptop the xev program reports that pressing this key gen-
       erates keycode 115, so to turn this key into a compose key,  I  do  the
       following:

         xmodmap -e 'keycode 115 = Multi_key'

       I  can  then  enter an i with a umlaut over it by typing this key, fol-
       lowed by ", followed by i.


</pre><h2>THE AVAILABLE KEY BINDING FUNCTIONS</h2><pre>
       The following is a list of the editing functions provided by the  Tecla
       library.  The  names  in the leftmost column of the list can be used in
       configuration files to specify which function a given key  or  combina-
       tion of keys should invoke. They are also used in the next two sections
       to list the default key-bindings in emacs and vi modes.

         user-interrupt           -  Send a SIGINT signal to the
                                     parent process.
         abort                    -  Send a SIGABRT signal to the
                                     parent process.
         suspend                  -  Suspend the parent process.
         stop-output              -  Pause terminal output.
         start-output             -  Resume paused terminal output.
         literal-next             -  Arrange for the next character
                                     to be treated as a normal
                                     character. This allows control
                                     characters to be entered.
         cursor-right             -  Move the cursor one character
                                     right.
         cursor-left              -  Move the cursor one character
                                     left.
         insert-mode              -  Toggle between insert mode and
                                     overwrite mode.
         beginning-of-line        -  Move the cursor to the
                                     beginning of the line.
         end-of-line              -  Move the cursor to the end of
                                     the line.
         delete-line              -  Delete the contents of the
                                     current line.
         kill-line                -  Delete everything that follows
                                     the cursor.
         backward-kill-line       -  Delete all characters between
                                     the cursor and the start of the
                                     line.
         forward-word             -  Move to the end of the word
                                     which follows the cursor.
         forward-to-word          -  Move the cursor to the start of
                                     the word that follows the
                                     cursor.
         backward-word            -  Move to the start of the word
                                     which precedes the cursor.
         goto-column              -  Move the cursor to the
                                     1-relative column in the line
                                     specified by any preceding
                                     digit-argument sequences (see
                                     ENTERING REPEAT COUNTS below).
         find-parenthesis         -  If the cursor is currently
                                     over a parenthesis character,
                                     move it to the matching
                                     parenthesis character. If not
                                     over a parenthesis character
                                     move right to the next close
                                     parenthesis.
         forward-delete-char      -  Delete the character under the
                                     cursor.
         backward-delete-char     -  Delete the character which
                                     precedes the cursor.
         list-or-eof              -  This is intended for binding
                                     to ^D. When invoked when the
                                     cursor is within the line it
                                     displays all possible
                                     completions then redisplays
                                     the line unchanged. When
                                     invoked on an empty line, it
                                     signals end-of-input (EOF) to
                                     the caller of gl_get_line().
         del-char-or-list-or-eof  -  This is intended for binding
                                     to ^D. When invoked when the
                                     cursor is within the line it
                                     invokes forward-delete-char.
                                     When invoked at the end of the
                                     line it displays all possible
                                     completions then redisplays
                                     the line unchanged. When
                                     invoked on an empty line, it

</pre><h2>DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS IN EMACS MODE</h2><pre>
       The following default key bindings, which can be overriden by the Tecla
       configuration  file,  are designed to mimic most of the bindings of the
       unix tcsh shell, when it is in emacs editing mode.

       This is the default editing mode of the Tecla library.

       Under UNIX the terminal driver sets a number of special keys  for  cer-
       tain  functions. The tecla library attempts to use the same keybindings
       to maintain consistency. The key sequences shown for  the  following  6
       bindings  are  thus just examples of what they will probably be set to.
       If you have used the stty  command  to  change  these  keys,  then  the
       default bindings should match.

         ^C     -&gt;   user-interrupt
         ^\     -&gt;   abort
         ^Z     -&gt;   suspend
         ^Q     -&gt;   start-output
         ^S     -&gt;   stop-output
         ^V     -&gt;   literal-next

       The  cursor  keys are refered to by name, as follows. This is necessary
       because different types of terminals generate different  key  sequences
       when their cursor keys are pressed.

         right  -&gt;   cursor-right
         left   -&gt;   cursor-left
         up     -&gt;   up-history
         down   -&gt;   down-history

       The remaining bindings don't depend on the terminal setttings.

       ated not only by pressing the control key and the @ key simultaneously,
       but  also  by  pressing  the  control key and the space bar at the same
       time.


</pre><h2>DEFAULT KEY BINDINGS IN VI MODE</h2><pre>
       The following default key bindings are designed to mimic the  vi  style
       of  editing  as  closely  as possible. This means that very few editing
       functions are provided in the initial  character  input  mode,  editing
       functions  instead  being  provided  by the vi command mode. Vi command
       mode is entered whenever the escape character is pressed, or whenever a
       key-sequence  that starts with a meta character is entered. In addition
       to mimicing vi, libtecla provides bindings for  tab  completion,  wild-
       card expansion of file names, and historical line recall.

       To  learn  how  to tell the Tecla library to use vi mode instead of the
       default emacs editing mode, see the earlier section entitled THE  TECLA
       CONFIGURATION FILE.

       Under  UNIX  the terminal driver sets a number of special keys for cer-
       tain functions. The Tecla library attempts to use the same  keybindings
       to maintain consistency, binding them both in input mode and in command
       mode. The key sequences shown for the following  6  bindings  are  thus
       just  examples  of  what they will probably be set to. If you have used
       the stty command to change these keys, then the default bindings should
       match.

         ^C     -&gt;   user-interrupt
         ^\     -&gt;   abort
         ^Z     -&gt;   suspend
         ^Q     -&gt;   start-output
         ^S     -&gt;   stop-output
         ^V     -&gt;   literal-next
         M-^C   -&gt;   user-interrupt
         M-^\   -&gt;   abort
         M-^Z   -&gt;   suspend
         M-^Q   -&gt;   start-output
         M-^S   -&gt;   stop-output

       Note  that above, most of the bindings are defined twice, once as a raw
       control code like ^C and then a second time as a  meta  character  like
       M-^C.  The  former is the binding for vi input mode, whereas the latter
       is the binding for vi command mode.  Once  in  command  mode  all  key-
       sequences  that the user types that they don't explicitly start with an
       escape or a meta key, have their first key secretly converted to a meta
       character  before  the key sequence is looked up in the key binding ta-
       ble. Thus, once in command mode, when you type the letter i, for  exam-
       ple, the Tecla library actually looks up the binding for M-i.

       The  cursor  keys are refered to by name, as follows. This is necessary
       because different types of terminals generate different  key  sequences
       when their cursor keys are pressed.

         right  -&gt;   cursor-right
         left   -&gt;   cursor-left
         up     -&gt;   up-history
         down   -&gt;   down-history

       The  cursor  keys  normally  generate  a keysequence that start with an
       escape character, so beware that using the arrow keys will put you into
       command mode (if you aren't already in command mode).

       The  following  are  the terminal-independent key bindings for vi input
       mode.

         ^D     -&gt;   list-or-eof
         ^G     -&gt;   list-glob
         ^H     -&gt;   backward-delete-char
         ^I     -&gt;   complete-word
         \r     -&gt;   newline
         \n     -&gt;   newline
         ^L     -&gt;   clear-screen
         ^N     -&gt;   down-history
         ^P     -&gt;   up-history
         ^R     -&gt;   redisplay
         ^U     -&gt;   backward-kill-line
         ^W     -&gt;   backward-delete-word
         ^X*    -&gt;   expand-filename
         ^X^F   -&gt;   read-from-file
         ^X^R   -&gt;   read-init-files
         ^?     -&gt;   backward-delete-char

       The following are the key bindings that are defined in vi command mode,
       this  being  specified  by  them all starting with a meta character. As
       mentioned above, once in command mode the  initial  meta  character  is
       optional.  For example, you might enter command mode by typing Esc, and
       then press h twice to move the cursor two positions to the left. Both h
       characters  get  quietly  converted to M-h before being compared to the
       key-binding table, the first one because Escape followed by a character
       is  always  converted  to the equivalent meta character, and the second
       because command mode was already active.

       Note that ^I is what the TAB key generates.


</pre><h2>ENTERING REPEAT COUNTS</h2><pre>
       Many of  the  key  binding  functions  described  previously,  take  an
       optional count, typed in before the target keysequence.  This is inter-
       preted as a repeat count by most bindings. A notable exception  is  the
       goto-column binding, which interprets the count as a column number.

       By default you can specify this count argument by pressing the meta key
       while typing in the numeric count. This relies  on  the  digit-argument
       action  being bound to Meta-0, Meta-1 etc.  Once any one of these bind-
       ings has been activated, you can optionally take your  finger  off  the
       meta  key  to type in the rest of the number, since every numeric digit
       thereafter is treated as part of the number, unless it is  preceded  by
       the  literal-next binding. As soon as a non-digit, or literal digit key
       is pressed the repeat count is terminated and either  causes  the  just
       typed  character to be added to the line that many times, or causes the
       next key-binding function to be given that argument.

       For example, in emacs mode, typing:

         M-12a

       causes the letter 'a' to be added to the line 12 times, whereas

         M-4M-c

       Capitalizes the next 4 words.

       In vi command mode the Meta modifier  is  automatically  added  to  all
       characters  typed  in,  so  to  enter  a count in vi command-mode, just
       involves typing in the number, just as it does in the vi editor itself.
       So for example, in vi command mode, typing:

         4w2x

       moves  the cursor four words to the right, then deletes two characters.

       You can also bind digit-argument to other key sequences. If  these  end
       in  a  numeric  digit,  that  digit gets appended to the current repeat
       count. If it doesn't end in a numeric digit,  a  new  repeat  count  is
       started  with  a  value  of zero, and can be completed by typing in the
       number, after letting go of the key which triggered the  digit-argument
       action.
