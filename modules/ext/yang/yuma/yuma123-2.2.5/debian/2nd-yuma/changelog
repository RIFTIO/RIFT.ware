      pointing at old.enu.dname so if old was freed, new.enu.name
      would point at garbage in the heap
    * fixed some memory leaks in error corner-cases
    * fixed bug where valid patterns parsed as non-strings
      were not correctly processed and no compiled pattern
      was created
    * fixed bug where unquoted prefixed string (foo:bar) would
      not be saved correctly in the compiled pattern (bar)

  * XML parse:
    * add tracefile support to debug input fed to XML textReader

  * CLI:
    * Change the signature of all instances of main to meet the 'c'
      standard.
