.SH NAME
make_sil_dir \- create a server instrumentation library working directory

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf

   make_sil_dir [--split] module-name

.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B make_sil_dir
is a script to create a server instrumentation library (SIL)
root work directory, for a specific YANG module.

If the \fB--split\fP parameter is present, then the
SIL code generated will be split in 'Yuma' files and 'User' files.
A Yuma SIL file or external definition begins with the prefix 'y_'.
A User SIL file or external definition begins with the prefix 'u_'.

The SIL code can be regenerated without calling this script
by invoking 'make code' from the 'src'
directory.

The following directories and files would be created
if the command 'make_sil_dir test' was called from the
directory ~/work (without the --split option):
.nf

 ~/work/test/ -+
               |
               + bin/
               |
               + lib/
               |
               + Makefile
               |
               + src/ -+
                       |
                       + Makefile
                       |
                       + test.c   (*** Developer edits this file ***)
                       |
                       + test.h

.fi
In --split mode, the Yuma files never need to be edited.
All the code that needs device instrumentation is contained
in the User SIL C file.

The SIL code can be regenerated without calling this script
by invoking 'make splitcode' from the 'src' directory.

The following directories and files would be created
if the command 'make_sil_dir --split test' was called from the
directory ~/work:
.nf

 ~/work/test/ -+
               |
               + bin/
               |
               + lib/
               |
               + Makefile
               |
               + src/ -+
                       |
                       + Makefile
                       |
                       + u_test.c   (*** Developer edits this file ***)
                       |
                       + u_test.h
                       |
                       + y_test.c
                       |
                       + y_test.h

.fi

.SH USAGE
This script must be called from the parent directory
where the SIL root work directory should be created.
The 'module-name' parameter will be used for the name
of the directory created.  It must match a module in the
normal module search path for the SIL code to
be generated.
