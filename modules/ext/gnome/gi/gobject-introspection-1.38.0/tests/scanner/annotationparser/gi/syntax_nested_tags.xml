 * GApplicationFlags:
 * @G_APPLICATION_NON_UNIQUE: Make no attempts to do any of the typical
 *     single-instance application negotiation, even if the application
 *     ID is given.  The application neither attempts to become the
 *     owner of the application ID nor does it check if an existing
 *     owner already exists.  Everything occurs in the local process.
 *     Since: 2.30.

 * Flags used to define the behaviour of a #GApplication.
