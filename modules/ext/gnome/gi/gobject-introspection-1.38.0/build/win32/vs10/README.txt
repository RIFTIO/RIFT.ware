Please do not compile this package (gobject-introspection) in paths that contain
spaces in them-as strange problems may occur during compilation or during
the use of the library.

Please refer to the following GNOME Live! page for more detailed
instructions on building gobject-introsecption and its dependencies
with Visual C++:

https://live.gnome.org/GTK%2B/Win32/MSVCCompilationOfGTKStack

This VS10 solution and the projects it includes are intented to be used
in a gobject-introspection source tree unpacked from a tarball. In a git checkout you
first need to use some Unix-like environment, which will do the work for you.

The required dependencies are Python 2.6 or later, GLib and LibFFI.  It is recommended
that GLib is built with Visual C++ 2010 to avoid problems cause by usage of different CRTs

Please refer to the README.txt file in $(GLib_src_root)\build\win32\vs10 on how to build
GLib using Visual C++ 2010

For LibFFI, please get version 3.0.10 or later, as Visual C++ build support
was added in the 3.0.10 release series.  Please see the README file that
comes with the LibFFI source package for more details on how to build LibFFI
on Visual C++-please note that the mozilla-build package from Mozilla is needed
in order to build LibFFI on Windows.

For Python, retrieving the official Windows binaries for 2.6 or later from
http://www.python.org will do the job-be sure that the Python version that
you downloaded matches the configuration of your build (win32 or x64/amd64).

For building the Regress test project, cairo (and possibly cairo-gobject support)
is needed.

Set up the source tree as follows under some arbitrary top
folder <root>:

<root>\<this-gobject-introspection-source-tree>
<root>\vs10\<PlatformName>

*this* file you are now reading is thus located at
<root>\<this-glib-source-tree>\build\win32\vs10\README.

<PlatformName> is either Win32 or x64, as in VS10 project files.

For LibFFI, one should also put the generated ffi.h and ffitarget.h
into <root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\include\ and the compiled static libffi.lib
(or copy libffi-convenience.lib into libffi.lib) into
<root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\lib\.

The libintl.h that is used for building GLib needs to be in
<root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\include, if not already done so

You will also need a working GCC/MinGW compiler installation
in order to generate the .gir and .typelib files.  One may be
obtained from the mingw or the mingw64 project.

A working pkg-config tool is also required-it may be obtained from
http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php [32-bit]
http://www.gtk.org/download/win64.php [64-bit]

*** Note! ***
Please note that due to numerous possible configurations on Python, some environmental
variables need to be set before launching the gobject-introsection.sln solution file.

These variables are namely:
PYTHONDIR: Root installation folder of your Python interpretor, where python.exe is
           located.  Currently only Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x is supported.
           It must match your build configuration (Win32 or x64/amd64)
PKG_CONFIG_PATH: Location of the .pc (pkg-config) files, especially for the GLib .pc files.
MINGWDIR: Root installation folder for your Windows GCC (such as MinGW).  For example,
          if your gcc executable (gcc.exe) is in c:\mingw\bin, use "set MINGWDIR=c:\mingw"
*** End of Note! ***

The "install" project will copy build results and headers into their
appropriate location under <root>\vs10\<PlatformName>. For instance,
built DLLs go into <root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\bin, built LIBs into
<root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\lib and gobject-introspection headers into
<root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\include\gobject-introsection-1.0.

The generated .gir files will end up in <root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\share\gir-1.0
and .typelib files will end up in <root>\vs10\<PlatformName>\lib\girepository-1.0

This is then from where
project files higher in the stack are supposed to look for them, not
from a specific gobject-introspection source tree.
