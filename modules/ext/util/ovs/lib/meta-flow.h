/* Open vSwitch fields
 * ===================
 *
 * A "field" is a property of a packet.  Most familiarly, "data fields" are
 * fields that can be extracted from a packet.
 *
 * Some data fields are always present as a consequence of the basic networking
 * technology in use.  Ethernet is the assumed base technology for current
 * versions of OpenFlow and Open vSwitch, so Ethernet header fields are always
 * available.
 *
 * Other data fields are not always present.  A packet contains ARP fields, for
 * example, only when its Ethernet header indicates the Ethertype for ARP,
 * 0x0806.  We say that a field is "applicable" when it is it present in a
 * packet, and "inapplicable" when it is not, and refer to the conditions that
 * determine whether a field is applicable as "prerequisites".  Some
 * VLAN-related fields are a special case: these fields are always applicable,
 * but have a designated value or bit that indicates whether a VLAN header is
 * present, with the remaining values or bits indicating the VLAN header's
 * content (if it is present).  See MFF_VLAN_TCI for an example.
 *
 * Conceptually, an inapplicable field does not have a value, not even a
 * nominal ``value'' such as all-zero-bits.  In many circumstances, OpenFlow
 * and Open vSwitch allow references only to applicable fields.  For example,
 * one may match a given field only if the match includes the field's
 * prerequisite, e.g. matching an ARP field is only allowed if one also matches
 * on Ethertype 0x0806.
 *
 * (Practically, however, OVS represents a field's value as some fixed member
 * in its "struct flow", so accessing that member will obtain some value.  Some
 * members are used for more than one purpose, e.g. the "tp_src" member
 * represents the TCP, UDP, and SCTP source port, so the value read may not
 * even make sense.  For this reason, it is important to know whether a field's
 * prerequisites are satisfied before attempting to read it.)
 *
 * Sometimes a packet may contain multiple instances of a header.  For example,
 * a packet may contain multiple VLAN or MPLS headers, and tunnels can cause
 * any data field to recur.  OpenFlow and Open vSwitch do not address these
 * cases uniformly.  For VLAN and MPLS headers, only the outermost header is
 * accessible, so that inner headers may be accessed only by ``popping''
 * (removing) the outer header.  (Open vSwitch supports only a single VLAN
 * header in any case.)  For tunnels, e.g. GRE or VXLAN, the outer header and
 * inner headers are treated as different data fields.
 *
 * OpenFlow and Open vSwitch support some fields other than data fields.
 * "Metadata fields" relate to the origin or treatment of a packet, but they
 * are not extracted from the packet data itself.  One example is the physical
 * port on which a packet arrived at the switch.  "Register fields" act like
 * variables: they give an OpenFlow switch space for temporary storage while
 * processing a packet.  Existing metadata and register fields have no
 * prerequisites.
 *
 * A field's value consists of an integral number of bytes.  Most data fields
 * are copied directly from protocol headers, e.g. at layer 2, MFF_ETH_SRC is
 * copied from the Ethernet source address and MFF_ETH_DST from the destination
 * address.  Other data fields are copied from a packet with padding, usually
 * with zeros and in the most significant positions (see e.g. MFF_MPLS_LABEL)
 * but not always (see e.g. MFF_IP_DSCP).  A final category of data fields is
 * transformed in other ways as they are copied from the packets, to make them
 * more useful for matching, e.g. MFF_IP_FRAG describes whether a packet is a
 * fragment but it is not copied directly from the IP header.
 *
 *
 * Field specifications
 * ====================
 *
 * Each of the enumeration values below represents a field.  The comments
 * preceding each enum must be in a stylized form that is parsed at compile
 * time by the extract-ofp-fields program.  The comment itself consists of a
 * series of paragraphs separate by blank lines.  The paragraphs consist of:
 *
 *     - The first paragraph gives the user-visible name of the field as a
 *       quoted string.  This is the name used for parsing and formatting the
 *       field.
 *
 *       For historical reasons, some fields have an additional name that is
 *       accepted as an alternative in parsing.  This name, when there is one,
 *       is given as a quoted string in parentheses along with "aka".  For
 *       example:
 *
 *           "tun_id" (aka "tunnel_id").
 *
 *       New fields should have only one name.
 *
 *     - Any number of paragraphs of free text that describe the field.  This
 *       is meant for human readers, so extract-ofp-fields ignores it.
 *
 *     - A final paragraph that consists of a series of key-value pairs, one
 *       per line, in the form "key: value." where the period at the end of the
 *       line is a mandatory part of the syntax.
 *
 * Every field must specify the following key-value pairs:
 *
 *   Type:
 *
 *     The format and size of the field's value.  Some possible values are
 *     generic:
 *
 *         u8: A one-byte field.
 *         be16: A two-byte field.
 *         be32: A four-byte field.
 *         be64: An eight-byte field.
 *
 *     The remaining values imply more about the value's semantics, though OVS
 *     does not currently take advantage of this additional information:
 *
 *         MAC: A six-byte field whose value is an Ethernet address.
 *         IPv6: A 16-byte field whose value is an IPv6 address.
 *
 *   Maskable:
 *
 *     Either "bitwise", if OVS supports matching any subset of bits in the
 *     field, or "no", if OVS only supports matching or wildcarding the entire
 *     field.
 *
 *   Formatting:
 *
 *     Explains how a field's value is formatted and parsed for human
 *     consumption.  Some of the options are fairly generally useful:
 *
 *       decimal: Formats the value as a decimal number.  On parsing, accepts
 *         decimal (with no prefix), hexadecimal with 0x prefix, or octal
 *         with 0 prefix.
 *
 *       hexadecimal: Same as decimal except nonzero values are formatted in
 *         hex with 0x prefix.  The default for parsing is *not* hexadecimal:
 *         only with a 0x prefix is the input in hexadecimal.
 *
 *       Ethernet: Formats and accepts the common format xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.
 *         6-byte fields only.
 *
 *       IPv4: Formats and accepts the common format w.x.y.z.  4-byte fields
 *         only.
 *
 *       IPv6: Formats and accepts the common IPv6 formats.  16-byte fields
 *         only.
 *
 *       OpenFlow 1.0 port: Accepts an OpenFlow well-known port name
 *         (e.g. "IN_PORT") in uppercase or lowercase, or a 16-bit port
 *         number in decimal.  Formats ports using their well-known names in
 *         uppercase, or in decimal otherwise.  2-byte fields only.
 *
 *       OpenFlow 1.1+ port: Same syntax as for OpenFlow 1.0 ports but for
 *         4-byte OpenFlow 1.1+ port number fields.
 *
 *     Others are very specific to particular fields:
 *
 *       frag: One of the strings "no", "first", "later", "yes", "not_later"
 *         describing which IPv4/v6 fragments are matched.
 *
 *       tunnel flags: Any number of the strings "df", "csum", "key", or
 *         "oam" separated by "|".
 *
 *       TCP flags: See the description of tcp_flags in ovs-ofctl(8).
 *
 *   Prerequisites:
 *
 *     The field's prerequisites.  The values should be straightfoward.
 *
 *   Access:
 *
 *     Either "read-only", for a field that cannot be changed via OpenFlow, or
 *     "read/write" for a modifiable field.
 *
 *   NXM:
 *
 *     If the field has an NXM field assignment, then this specifies the NXM
 *     name of the field (e.g. "NXM_OF_ETH_SRC"), followed by its nxm_type in
 *     parentheses, followed by "since v<x>.<y>" specifying the version of Open
 *     vSwitch that first supported this field in NXM (e.g. "since v1.1" if it
 *     was introduced in Open vSwitch 1.1).
 *
 *     The NXM name must begin with NXM_OF_ or NXM_NX_.  This allows OVS to
 *     determine the correct NXM class.
 *
 *     If the field does not have an NXM field assignment, specify "none".
 *
 *   OXM:
 *
 *     If the field has an OXM field assignment, then this specifies the OXM
 *     name of the field (e.g. "OXM_OF_ETH_SRC"), followed by its nxm_type in
 *     parentheses, followed by "since OF<a>.<b> v<x>.<y>" specifying the
 *     versions of OpenFlow and Open vSwitch that first supported this field in
 *     OXM (e.g. "since OF1.3 and v1.10" if it was introduced in OpenFlow 1.3
 *     and first supported by Open vSwitch in version 1.10).
 *
 *     Some fields have more than one OXM field assignment.  For example,
 *     actset_output has an experimenter OXM assignment in OpenFlow 1.3 and a
 *     standard OXM assignment in OpenFlow 1.5.  In such a case, specify both,
 *     separated by commas.
 *
 *     OVS uses the start of the OXM field name to determine the correct OXM
 *     class.  To support a new OXM class, edit the mapping table in
 *     build-aux/extract-ofp-fields.
 *
 *     If the field does not have an OXM field assignment, specify "none".
 *
 * The following key-value pairs are optional.  Open vSwitch already supports
 * all the fields to which they apply, so new fields should probably not
 * include these pairs:
 *
 *   OF1.0:
 *
 *     Specify this as "exact match" if OpenFlow 1.0 can match or wildcard the
 *     entire field, or as "CIDR mask" if OpenFlow 1.0 can match any CIDR
 *     prefix of the field.  (OpenFlow 1.0 did not support bitwise matching.)
 *     Omit, if OpenFlow 1.0 did not support this field.
 *
 *   OF1.1:
 *
 *     Specify this as "exact match" if OpenFlow 1.1 can match or wildcard the
 *     entire field, or as "bitwise" if OpenFlow 1.1 can match any subset of
 *     bits in the field.  Omit, if OpenFlow 1.1 did not support this field.
 *
 * The following key-value pair is optional:
 *
 *   Prefix lookup member:
 *
 *     If this field makes sense for use with classifier_set_prefix_fields(),
 *     specify the name of the "struct flow" member that corresponds to the
 *     field.
 *
 * Finally, a few "register" fields have very similar names and purposes,
 * e.g. MFF_REG0 through MFF_REG7.  For these, the comments may be merged
 * together using <N> as a metasyntactic variable for the numeric suffix.
 * Lines in the comment that are specific to one of the particular fields by
 * writing, e.g. <1>, to consider that line only for e.g. MFF_REG1.

     *     packets that have an 802.1Q header with that VID (and any PCP).

     *   - Testing with a specific PCP and CFI=1, with nxm_mask=0xf000, matches
     *     packets that have an 802.1Q header with that PCP (and any VID).
     *
     *   - Testing with nxm_value=0, nxm_mask=0x0fff matches packets with no
     *     802.1Q header or with an 802.1Q header with a VID of 0.
     *

     * IP fragment handling mode:
     *
     *   - In OFPC_FRAG_DROP mode, the OpenFlow switch drops all IP fragments
     *     before they reach the flow table, so every packet that is available
     *     for matching will have value 0 in this field.
     *
     *   - Open vSwitch does not implement OFPC_FRAG_REASM mode, but if it did
     *     then IP fragments would be reassembled before they reached the flow
     *     table and again every packet available for matching would always
     *     have value 0.
     *
     *   - In OFPC_FRAG_NORMAL mode, all three values are possible, but
     *     OpenFlow 1.0 says that fragments' transport ports are always 0, even
     *     for the first fragment, so this does not provide much extra
     *     information.
     *
     *   - In OFPC_FRAG_NX_MATCH mode, all three values are possible.  For
     *     fragments with offset 0, Open vSwitch makes L4 header information
     *     available.
