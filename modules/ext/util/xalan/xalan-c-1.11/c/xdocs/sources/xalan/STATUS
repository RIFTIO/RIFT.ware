<s3 title="Version of &xml4c; to use"> 
<p>&xslt4c-current; has been tested with &xml4c-used;.</p>
<p>For information about including the Xerces-C++ libraries on the path, 
   see <link idref="install" anchor="path">Setting up the system path</link>.</p>
<p><em>Important:</em> You may experience unpredictable anomalies if your 
   Xalan and Xerces builds are not in synch. If you download an update to Xalan, 
   check the release notes to determine which version of Xerces you should use.</p>
<p>If you compile both &xslt4c; and &xml4c; from distribution sources using the same 
   platform and compiler, you will avoid most of the compatibility issues.</p>
