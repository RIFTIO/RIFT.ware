uinet directory layout:

Directory	Description
=============	=============================================================
bin		Test/sample programs that use libuinet.
lib		Libraries that are or use the user-space networking stack.
lib/libev	Port of libev-4.15 that provides a uinet watcher type so uinet
		sockets can be used in libev-based programs.
lib/libuinet	Library containing the user-space port of the FreeBSD TCP/IP
		stack and additional management and configuration interfaces.
		Many kernel interfaces (or portions thereof) had to be
		reimplemented for the port.  Kernel functionality implemented
		in <kern_file>.c in the kernel source tree can generally be
		found in uinet_<kern_file>.c in this directory. 
lib/libuinet/api_include
		Public includes for libuinet.
lib/libuinet/override_include
		Header overrides for some of the FreeBSD kernel headers.
lib/libuinet/opt
		Kernel option headers required by the port. The kernel
		configuration is modified by editing these files.
mk		Port of requisite FreeBSD kernel make infrastructure to gmake.
sys		Subset of the FreeBSD kernel source tree required by this port
		of the TCP/IP stack.  Subdirs have been imported in their
		entirety from the FreeBSD sources, even if not all the sources
		therein will be used, in order to make merging with newer
		kernel code more straightforward.
