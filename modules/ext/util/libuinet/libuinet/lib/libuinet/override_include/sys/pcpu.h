/*
 * Normally, the way the DPCPU (dynamic per-CPU) data facility works is that
 * DPCPU_DECLARE() is used to allocate an instance of a (possibly
 * statically-initialized) data structure in a particular linker section
 * (aka, 'the linker set').  At runtime, the total size of that linker set
 * is known, based on the linker-generated symbols at the start and end
 * addresses of the section.  When each CPU initializes, it allocates memory
 * in that amount (technically, rounded up to the next PAGE_SIZE),
 * initializes it by copying the contents of the linker section described
 * above into it, and attaches it to the PCPU (per-CPU) data structure for
 * that CPU.  A given instance of a dynamic per-cpu data structure is then
 * accessed via a pointer, whose address is computed by taking the offset
 * between the symbol created by DPCPU_DECLARE() and the start of the linker
 * section and adding that offset to the address of the per-CPU memory area
 * allocated at CPU-initialization time.
 *
 * We reimplement this in UINET because we wish to not use linker sets, as
 * they represent an obstacle to portability (for example, to systems using
 * Mach-O, which restricts section names to 16 characters).  In this
 * alternate implementation, the data structures allocated via
 * DPCPU_DECLARE() are not placed in any special section.  Instead,
 * automatically generated constructor functions are used to store context
 * for each data structure, including its address, its size, and an assigned
 * offset within the dynamic per-CPU memory areas, as well as track the
 * total size of all of the so-declared data structures.
 *
 * During startup, this array and summary information created by the
 * constructors during the runtime environment initialization is used to
 * synthesize the equivalent to a linker set in memory.  With this, and the
 * DPCPU_*() macro implementations adjusted where necessary to use this
 * information, the entire existing implementation in subr_pcpu.c can be
 * used without modification.
