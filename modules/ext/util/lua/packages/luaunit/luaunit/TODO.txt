TODO v3.1:
============
- reduce output when --quiet is used to standard output of python unit-tests
- check documentation link glitch to TAP 
- mention that general error are correctly handled by luaunit as failures
- in rst, check how to document properly optional parameters
- fill extra junit test parameters (duration, ...)
- strip luaunit stack more intelligently: exclude content of luaunit

TODO Future:
============
- compatibility with LuaUnit v2.0 of rjbcomputing
- provide a luarock package. See: https://rocks.moonscript.org/modules/rjpcomputing/luaunit
- improve testresult:
	- contain the list of tests, with status of each test
- improve junit output:
	- make number of failures part of the xml <testsuites>
- randomized testing
- coloured output
- global setup / teardown
- class setup / teardown
- distinguish errors and failures
- test failures, verify that output is correct
- add date and duration to tap output, junit output
- validate test output (TAP, ...) with functional tests
- validate well-formed XML with a DTD
- better error messages for table assertions:
	+ expected length of X, got Y
	+ keys differing in table 1 and 2
- allow to skip tests

Nice to have: 
============
- lua 5.3 ? Need to wait for support by travis-CI
- stack unwrapping like in py.test

Done since 3.0:
===============
x mention mailing-list in README.md
x validate well-formed xml
x mention version in documentation
x mention mailing-list
x mention the new global variable config for displaying table content
x XML output:
	+ tests to validate XML generation with data that contains XML already
	+ move tests to tests
x fix display of tables with recursive references
x improve display of nested tables in error messages
x improve display of multiline strings in error messages
x fix junit output

Done:
============
x add other types of output
x assert with matching of the error message
x finish user documentation
x switch version 3.0
x add assertMatch for strings
x document --name
x improve junit xml output (one file, choice of filename) 
x display number of non selected tests
x assertIs with all types
x mention one file distribution
x improve TAP output: pre-calculate test numbers, display test summary as comment
x test error messages of assertStrMatches and all error functions
x assertNil + assertNotNil
x readthedocs integration
x add travis-ci badges to README
x filter by pattern
x support --version
x support --help
x replace methodInstance with real test name in reports
x better error messages for wrong command line option, or wrong output type
x control verbosity and output type with command line
x display time to run all tests
x move all assertions together
x better error display of assertIsXXX functions
x add assertContains for strings
x add assertIsNumber, assertIsXXX
x table assertions
x sequence asserts
x compatibilty tests with several version of lua
x add assertNotEquals
