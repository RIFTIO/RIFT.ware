Due to licensing restrictions, Confd cannot be distributed along with Riftware.

The Confd 6.0 package must be licenced and downloaded from Tail-F.

Once extracted the following files should be copied into the following locations

    - confd-6.0.linux.x86_64.installer.bin -> confd/
    - confd-6.0.libconfd.tar.gz -> libconfd/libconfd-6.0/

Once copied, add and commit the packages to your repository:

    - git add .
    - cd <rift_repo_root>
    - git xcommit -a -m "Adding confd6.0 packages"
    - git xpush
