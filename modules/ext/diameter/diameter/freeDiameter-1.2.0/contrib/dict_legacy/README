The dictionary.dtd file originates from draft-frascone-xml-dictionary-00.
A few modifications may have been performed (see file history in Mercurial)
However, no DTD validation is performed by the parser, but the extension
expects a known format therefore the flexibility is limited.


Additional XML dictionary files can be found:
  - Circum project (circum.sf.net)
  	under share/*.xml

  - OpenDiameter project (diameter.sf.net)
  	under libdiameter/config/dictionary.xml (will probably require some stripping)
