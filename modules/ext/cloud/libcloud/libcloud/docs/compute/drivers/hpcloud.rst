1. Instantiating the driver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike other OpenStack based providers, HP cloud also requires you to specify
tenant name when connecting to their cloud. You can do that by passing
``tenant_name`` argument to the driver constructor as shown in the code example
bellow.

This attribute represents a project name and can be obtained in the `HP Cloud
console`_ as shown in the picture bellow.
