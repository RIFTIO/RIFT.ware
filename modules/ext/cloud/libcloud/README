Details on pristine tracking of GIT upstream libcloud repository:

Upstream for packages being maintained in publically accessible git
repositories may be directly imported, tracked, and merged using the
git subtree utility.  (Note that this is not the 'git merge -s
subtree' merge strategy).

Should upstream cease to be available in GIT, we can revert to manual
creation of a pristine branch for the package and feed it with
tarballs.

Import a new upstream project's HEAD on branch master into the
repository-local path libcloud/libcloud, as a single changeset (the
--squash):

  git subtree add --prefix=libcloud/libcloud -m 'Initial port of libcloud' --squash https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/libcloud.git HEAD

Merge any new changes since the import or last merge into the local libcloud work:

  git subtree pull --prefix=libcloud/libcloud -m 'Merge libcloud version X.XX' --squash https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/libcloud.git HEAD
