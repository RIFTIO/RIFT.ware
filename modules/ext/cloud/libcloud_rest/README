Details on pristine tracking of GIT upstream libcloud.rest-1 repository:

This is a fork of islamgulov/libcloud.rest

Upstream for packages being maintained in publically accessible git
repositories may be directly imported, tracked, and merged using the
git subtree utility.  (Note that this is not the 'git merge -s
subtree' merge strategy).

Should upstream cease to be available in GIT, we can revert to manual
creation of a pristine branch for the package and feed it with
tarballs.

Import a new upstream project's HEAD on branch master into the
repository-local path libcloud_rest/libcloud_rest, as a single changeset (the
--squash):

  git subtree add --prefix=libcloud_rest/libcloud_rest -m 'Initial port of libcloud_rest' --squash https://github.com/Kami/libcloud.rest-1.git HEAD

Merge any new changes since the import or last merge into the local libcloud_rest work:

  git subtree pull --prefix=libcloud_rest/libcloud_rest -m 'Merge libcloud_rest version X.XX' --squash https://github.com/Kami/libcloud.rest-1.git HEAD
