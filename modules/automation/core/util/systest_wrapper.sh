# Script for invoking and managing separate system, configuration and test processes.
#
#    systest_wrapper.sh --system_cmd "<system_cmd> --test_cmd "<test_cmd>" [--config_cmd "<config_cmd>"]
#                       [--dts_cmd "<dts_cmd>"] [--sink_cmd "<sink_cmd>"] [--wait] [--sysinfo]
#
# The system is command is run in the background while the config command
# (if provided) and test commands are run sequentially in the foreground.
# Since the config/test commands are run immediately after the system is started,
# they must be capable of determining when the system is ready to be configured/tested.
#
# Arguments:
#   system_cmd - The command which starts the system (which runs in the background).
#   log_stdout - Log file which captures a duplicate of the console stdout
#   log_stderr - Log file which captures a duplicate of the console stderr
#   config_cmd - The command which configures the running system in preparation to be tested.
#   test_cmd   - The command which tests the now started an configured system.
#   dts_cmd    - The command which enables dts tracing for a client, such as uAgent.
#   sink_cmd   - The command which is responsible for setting up the logging sink.
#   wait       - Block after test until receiving interrupt or kill signal
#   sysinfo    - The option to "show sysinfo" when the test fails.
#   confd_ip   - IP address of confd, optional. Defaults to localhost.
#   post_restart_test_cmd - The command which tests the re-started system. If specified the
#                           system is restarted.
#
# Exit Code:
#   0 if the system started successfully and the provided config/test commands.
#   The exit code of the config_cmd if unsuccessful, otherwise the test_cmd exit code.

# If wait is specified, block until receiving an INT or TERM signal
# before continuing on to shut down the system
